-   ### Design

    -   #### Structure
    
        -   The structure of the website was purposely designed to maintain a fluid, consistent display throughout as to not look cluttered, easy to navigate and easy to find what you are looking for.
        
        -   Website Colors and Font: Website colors and font remain consistent throughout.
    
    -   #### Colour Scheme
    
        -   The color scheme on this website is based on the Premier League brand which is meant to reinforce the brand identity and I feel it's appealing and easy on the eye.

    -   #### Typography
    
        -   [Bree Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bree+Serif?query=bree) is the main font used throughout the whole website with San-serif as the fallback font in                   case for any reason the font isn't being recognized on different operating systems.

### Testing
Testing information can be found here in the separate [TESTING.md]()

## Deployment

This project was developed using Gitpod IDE and pushed to Github using the in-built terminal. Github can only host static websites it was necessary to deploy this project to Heroku because it is a compatible hosting platform for a back-end focused websits like this one.

This project was deployed using Heroku and stored in GitHub.

Before deploying the website to Heroku, the following three must be followed to allow the app to work in Heroku:

1. Create requirements.txt file that contains the names of packages being used in Python. It is important to update this file if other packages or modules are installed during project development by using the following command:
    - pip freeze --local > requirements.txt

2. Create Procfile that contains the name of the application file so that Heroku knows what to run. If the Procfile has a blank line when it is created remove this as this may cause problems.

3. Then push these files to GitHub. Once those steps are done, the website can be deployed in Heroku.

### Heroku Deployment:

    1. Log into Heroku.
    2. Click the New button.
    3. Click the option to create a new app.
    4. Enter the app name in lowercase letters.
    5. Select the correct geographical region.

### Setting the environment variables:

Navigate to the settings tab and then click the Reveal Config Vars button and add the following:

    1. key: IP, value: 0.0.0.0
    2. key: PORT, value: 5000
    3. key: MONGO_DBNAME, value: (the name of the database that is being used for the project)
    4. key: MONGO_URI, value:
    
    - This can be found in MongoDB by navigating to the clusters section of your MongoDB account.
    - Click the cluster where the database is located.
    - Click the connect button.
    - Select the connect you application button.
    - Copy the link provided to your application and ensure you have substituted the password and dbname with the correct values).

    5. key: SECRET_KEY, value: (This is a custom secret key set up for configuration to keep client-side sessions secure).
    
### Enable automatic deployment:

    1. Click the Deploy tab
    2. In the Automatic deploys section, choose the branch you want to deploy from then click Enable Automation Deploys.

### Connect app to Github Repository
    1. Click the deploy tab and connect to GitHub.
    2. Type the name of the repository into the search bar presented.
    3. Click the Code dropdown button next to the green Gitpod button.
    4. When the correct repository displays click the connect button.

### Making a clone to run locally

It is important to note that this project will not run locally unless an env.py file has been set up by the user which contains the IP, PORT, MONGO_DBNAME, MONGO_URI and SECRET_KEY which have all been kept secret in keeping with best security practices.

    1. Log into GitHub.
    2. Select the respository.
    3. Click the Code dropdown button next to the green Gitpod button.
    4. Download ZIP file and unpackage locally and open with IDE. Alternatively copy the URL in the HTTPS box.
    5. Open the alternative editor and terminal window.
    6. Type 'git clone' and paste the copied URL.
    7. Press Enter. A local clone will be created.
    
Once the project been loaded into the IDE it is necessary to install the necessary requirements which can be done by typing the following command.

-   -pip install -r requirements.txt
